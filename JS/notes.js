/*
	Alternatively, you can use the String’s charAt() method to access individual characters. For example, 
	quote.charAt(6) would also return "w". You’ll learn more about methodslater in this course.

	NaN stands for "Not-A-Number" and it's often returned indicating an error with number operations. For instance, 
	if you wrote some code that performed a math calculation, and the calculation failed to produce a valid number, 
	NaN might be returned
		
	null refers to the "value of nothing", while undefined refers to the "absence of value".
