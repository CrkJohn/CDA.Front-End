An image is made with an <img> element. It looks like so:

<img src="http://somewebsite.com/image.jpg" alt="short description">

The source attribute, src, is like the href of a link - it is the URL of 
the image you want to display. For now, your images will need to be hosted online, 
which means that the URL will need to start with http:// or https://. You'll learn 
about another way to set image source in the next exercise. The alt attribute stands 
for "alternative description," which is important for people who use screen readers 
to browse the web. This is text that will show up in lieu of the actual image.
